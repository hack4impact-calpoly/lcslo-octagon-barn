## Overview

### Purpose
The Octagon Barn Center aims to showcase the rare and iconic landmark to guests with the help of volunteer and donors. The Land Conservancy of SLO works with landowners and government to care for the diverse wildlands and critical habitats of the Central Coast through conservation, restoration, and stewardship, all while connecting people to the land and one another. 
Currently there is no streamlined process for vendors and clients to submit insurance documents directly on the website which leads to inefficiencies in handling and approval. Our goal is to develop management platform for vendors and clients at the Octagon Barn. This platform will greatly improve efficiency and organization, reducing manual tasks and helping ensure they stay on top of event logistics.
